# Expense_Tracker

Work in progress..
/*
**************************************************TO-DO**************************************************
Core Features
Add, View, and Delete Expenses: Users can enter new expenses, view existing ones, and delete entries as needed.

Summary and Reports: The program can display total expenses, or summaries by day, month, year, or category.

Data Persistence: Expenses are often saved to and loaded from a file (such as .txt or .csv) to persist data between sessions.

User-Friendly Interface: A console menu guides users through available options.

Error Handling: Basic input validation helps prevent crashes and invalid data entry.


How it can scale:
Intermediate Level: If you add features like object-oriented design (using multiple classes), advanced file handling (CSV, JSON), date/time management, or data validation, it can become an intermediate-level project.

Advanced Level: Introducing a graphical user interface (GUI), database integration (e.g., SQLite), or advanced reporting and analytics would push it toward an advanced level.
